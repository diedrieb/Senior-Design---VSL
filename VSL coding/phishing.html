        This project came to life because one of our team members and someone they knew went through looking for a place with certain requirements. 
        It was difficult for them to do that since not many web applications like Zillow, Facebook, or Apartments.com could provide what they want.  
        This idea is so future students have a pleasant and easy-going experience when looking for housing with their criteria.

    <center><h2>Avoid Scams and Fraud </h2>  </center>
      <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> <center>
        With the use of online services for buying and selling anything from retail items, food, and housing, it is important that we keep our users 
        aware of the evolving social engineering tactics that are being used to scam online shoppers into releasing personal information to malicious 
        actors. It is important to remember that a lot of individuals whom you are trying to conduct business with are probably people you do not know
        personally, which makes it that much harder to tell what is a legitimate offer and what is not. While we are working hard to provide an online marketplace for
        safe and legitimate housing listings for UC students, there are still scammers out there that are interested in stealing your confidential information and 
        hard earned money. With social engineering being one of the leading causes of data/financial theft in the online world, together we can limit the damage to our 
        valued users by making a lot of these tactics and red flags known to our community. While we are working around the clock to ensure that fraudulent listings do not
        flood our site, we understand that these kinds of listings can arise.<br>

        <pre style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif"><b>Important Message: If you encounter a liting that you believe to be fraudulent, please utilize the "Report Listing" option on our site to alert our team 
        of the listing in question and we can work to investigate.</b></pre></center>

    <center><h2>RED FLAGS FOR SCAMS</h2></center>
    
      <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> <center><pre style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
        - Rent that is being offered at an extremely low price: This is a big red flag for scams in the housing market. A lot of times malicious actors will 
        list properties for a very low price compared to market price in order to get you to close more rapidly, allowing for them to gain confidential 
        information faster.

        - Grammatical Errors: Spelling and grammatical errors within the communication chain is usually a sign of fraud. Reputable sources will take the time to construct well
        organized and professional communication.

        - Excessive requests for personal or financial information: If the sources of the lisitng are unknown to you, it is important you not send any form of personal
        information such as bank routing numbers or your social security number. This information should be handled carefully over the internet in any situation. 

        - Requests to wire money into specific account: Landlords will not usually ask tenants to wire money to a specific account, so if the lister is asking for that 
        directly, this is likely a fradulent listing.

        - Impersonation of our site, Value Student Living: We do not deal with transactions between landlords and tentants, so if you are receving messages that appear
        to be from us pertaining to financial transactions, it is a scam.

        - Lack of in-person meeting between landlord and tenant: If the entity you are communicating with is refusing to meet you at the property in person, whether
        by making up stories as to why they cannot meet or telling you it is acceptable for you to look at the property from the outside yourself, this is likely a scam. 
        Always meet with potential landlords at the property to ensure the listing is not fraudulent.
