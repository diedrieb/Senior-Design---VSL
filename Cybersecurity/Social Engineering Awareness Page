Avoid Scams and Fraud 

With the use of online services for buying and selling anything from retail items, food, and housing, it is important that we keep our users 
aware of the evolving social engineering tactics that are being used to scam online shoppers into releasing personal information to malicious 
actors. It is important to remember that a lot of individuals whom you are trying to conduct business with are probably people you do not know
personally, which makes it that much harder to tell what is a legitimate offer and what is not. While we are working hard to provide an online marketplace for
safe and legitimate housing listings for UC students, there are still scammers out there that are interested in stealing your confidential information and 
hard earned money. With social engineering being one of the leading causes of data/financial theft in the online world, together we can limit the damage to our 
valued users by making a lot of these tactics and red flags known to our community. While we are working around the clock to ensure that fraudulent listings do not
flood our site, we understand that these kinds of listings can arise. 

Important Message: If you encounter a liting that you believe to be fraudulent, please utilize the "Report Listing" option on our site to alert our team 
of the listing in question and we can work to investigate. 

RED FLAGS FOR SCAMS 

- Rent that is being offered at an extremely low price: This is a big red flag for scams in the housing market. A lot of times malicious actors will 
list properties for a very low price compared to market price in order to get you to close more rapidly, allowing for them to gain confidential 
information faster. 

- Grammatical Errors: Spelling and grammatical errors within the communication chain is usually a sign of fraud. Reputable sources will take the time to construct well
organized and professional communication.

- Excessive requests for personal or financial information: If the sources of the lisitng are unknown to you, it is important you not send any form of personal
information such as bank routing numbers or your social security number. This information should be handled carefully over the internet in any situation. 

- Requests to wire money into specific account: Landlords will not usually ask tenants to wire money to a specific account, so if the lister is asking for that 
directly, this is likely a fradulent listing. 

- Impersonation of our site, Value Student Living: We do not deal with transactions between landlords and tentants, so if you are receving messages that appear
to be from us pertaining to financial transactions, it is a scam. 

- Lack of in-person meeting between landlord and tenant: If the entity you are communicating with is refusing to meet you at the property in person, whether
by making up stories as to why they cannot meet or telling you it is acceptable for you to look at the property from the outside yourself, this is likely a scam. 
Always meet with potential landlords at the property to ensure the listing is not fraudulent. 

REPORTING FRAUDULENT LISTINGS

There are many ways to report fraudulent listings. Real estate fraud is a misdemeanor and even possibly a felony depending on the severity of the fraud. If you 
are a victim of a fraudulent listing, be sure to report the listing, all communications, and any fincnaical records to any of the following: 

1. Value Student Living: Utilize the report button on our listings to alert us of a potential scam. 
2. Local law enforcement department 
3. The Federal Trade Commission
4. The FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center

NOTE: Scammers will likely request funds before offerinf the propery, which is unorthodox. Another red flag to look for financially is requests for funds through
third party applications such as Venmo, Cashapp, Bitcoin, etc.
